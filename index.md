##  Analysis of Maze Solving Algorithms using a Micro Mouse Robot


### Objective
- Conduct an experiment using an actual maze solving robot inside of a constructed maze that will compare the random mouse algorithm vs Tremouxâ€™s algorithm. 
- This experiment will examine average time needed to complete the maze, and the variance in these results.

### Materials
- 4' X 8' MDF Board (Maze Floor)
- 3ea 4' X 2' Particle Board (Cut to size for maze walls)
- Velcro Strips 
- Staple Gun with Staples
- Black Electrical tape (use for mouse to follow)

### Tech
- PICAXE 'PICone' Micromouse (Kit 110)
- PICAXE Editor 6 (Software Application)
